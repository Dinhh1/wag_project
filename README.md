# Wag Interview Project


## Installation/Building

wag-project uses [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) for dependency
management.

The project has pod dependencies included so the project should run as is.
Then run `open wag-project.xcworkspace`. Do **not** open `wag-project.xcodeproj`
or the project will not build.


## Third Party Libraries
- AFNetworking - Used to simplify making network request to web services and async image downloading and caching functionalities
- DZNEmptyDataSet - Used to provide feedback in tableview when connection has error, dataset is empty or when data is loading
